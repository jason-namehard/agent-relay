A local handoff desk for people who work with several AI agents. Pass a file or request from A to B, see who holds the task now, and stop the loop when the work is actually done.

If you use more than one agent, the work usually moves by copy and paste: you paste a request into one session, wait, copy the answer into another, and lose track of which session received what, whether it was picked up, and whether a changed file means the work is finished. Agent Relay keeps each handoff as a task in a local relay folder with a SQLite ledger, shows its progress in a Windows desktop app, and separates "the message was submitted" from "the task was completed with a receipt". You decide the agents and their roles; Relay only needs to know who sends and who receives.

Current state: preview software, Windows x64 desktop. Source is `0.1.1`; the latest public download is `0.1.0-preview.22` (see below). The CLI and stdio MCP server have Windows and Linux CI coverage. There is no macOS desktop package, no cloud relay and no background service after every process closes.

## Quick start

### Windows installer (source candidate `0.1.1`)

The installer `AgentRelay-v0.1.1-windows-x64-setup.exe` is built from this source tree and is **not** published on GitHub Releases yet; once uploaded it installs into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Agent Relay` as a per-user install with no admin prompt. It has no code signature and bundles the .NET runtime for the desktop app, the CLI and the MCP server. Start it from the Start menu, or run:

```powershell
"$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Agent Relay\app\gui\AgentRelay.Desktop.exe"
"$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Agent Relay\app\relay.exe" --help    # app\mcp\relay-mcp.exe is self-contained too
```

The installer is verified locally by running it in a disposable profile: the install, uninstall, "keep data", "remove rules only" and "clear ledger and preferences, keep workspace files" choices, cancellation, and a Chinese-path uninstall have been exercised; true end-to-end coverage of a corrupted rule file is provided by unit tests rather than a completed interactive run.

### Published preview `0.1.0-preview.22`

Download the ZIP from the [release page](https://github.com/jason-namehard/agent-relay/releases/tag/v0.1.0-preview.22) or with PowerShell. Extract the whole archive into a new folder; do not run files from inside the ZIP.

```powershell
$version = 'v0.1.0-preview.22'
$zip = "AgentRelay-$version-windows-x64.zip"
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/jason-namehard/agent-relay/releases/download/$version/$zip" -UseBasicParsing -OutFile $zip
Expand-Archive $zip -DestinationPath ".\AgentRelay-$version"
Set-Location ".\AgentRelay-$version"

.\TryDemo.cmd                    # isolated demo: sample Agents, preset tasks, no model account, no model calls
.\gui\AgentRelay.Desktop.exe     # normal use
```

<details>
<summary>Verify the downloaded ZIP against the GitHub asset digest</summary>

```powershell
$release = Invoke-RestMethod "https://api.github.com/repos/jason-namehard/agent-relay/releases/tags/$version"
$asset = $release.assets | Where-Object name -eq $zip
if (-not $asset.digest) { throw 'The release API did not provide an asset digest.' }
$actual = 'sha256:' + (Get-FileHash -LiteralPath $zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLowerInvariant()
if ($actual -ne $asset.digest) { throw 'The file does not match the GitHub asset.' }
```

Local and CI builds are not claimed to be byte-for-byte reproducible.

</details>

Requirements: the installer and the desktop app bundle their runtime, including the installed `relay.exe` and `mcp\relay-mcp.exe`. The portable ZIP's CLI and MCP server (`relay.dll`, `mcp\relay-mcp.dll`) need the [.NET 10 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0). There is no code signing, so Windows may show a security prompt. "No account" refers to Relay itself and the demo; the agents you connect still use their own accounts, permissions and model billing.

## The four pages

![Agents: names, bridge status and the optional handoff rule](docs/images/ui-agents.png)

| Page | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Tasks | Left list, right detail. Create automatic or manual transfers, read request, reply and processing history together, filter by all / needs attention / in progress / completed, select several tasks for batch actions. |
| Agents | Register a sender and a recipient under any names. One-click setup inspects the local host and imports a calling method; manual fields are always available. Each Agent row has edit, test, recovery and delete actions; the detail card shows bridge status and the optional one-line handoff rule. |
| Connections | One line per Agent pair. Arrows show which directions have a verified calling method, green/red shows whether each direction is enabled, grey dashed means no method. Click a line to manage both directions with switches; manual copy works regardless. |
| Settings | Appearance (five themes, accent colour, six languages), notifications and sounds, relay storage, retention, advanced timeouts, and a danger zone. Changes apply immediately. |

![Connections: direction, method and enablement are separate](docs/images/ui-connections.png)

## How a handoff works

### Automatic CLI transfer

1. Register A and B. **One-click setup** in **New Agent** reads CLI help and non-secret settings, then imports a calling method when one is available. If the local interface cannot run, use the manual fields instead of pasting a configuration block.
2. Choose **New task → New automatic transfer task**. Select A (and optionally the source conversation; without one, the turn for A is copied manually), select B, and choose a new or existing target conversation. Write the work request; Relay prepares the prompt and calls the selected CLI.
3. Choose a **single handoff** — it ends when B finishes — or **keep revising until the review passes**. In review mode you pick the final reviewer, type acceptance criteria or have the initiating Agent prepare them, and can set a review limit. The reviewer requests concrete changes or approves with no open items. Relay records that decision; it does not independently verify the work.
4. Create the task. Explicitly allow any direction that is not enabled yet, since automatic sending requires a verified method for that Agent. The board names the current worker, role, round and phase. Later turns resume the exact bound conversation; if that conversation is missing, Relay asks for another choice instead of falling back to the latest one.

![Settings: appearance, notifications and storage in one place](docs/images/ui-settings.png)

### Manual transfer

1. **New task → New manual transfer task**, choose sender and recipient, write the request. Copy the prompt for the sender and paste it into that session.
2. Paste the sender's JSON reply back into Relay and parse it to create the task, or pick an existing file.
3. Copy the next prompt to the Agent the board names. Receipts are read while Relay is running and on refresh; keep passing turns as the work needs, and the task ends only when it is explicitly complete.
4. Optionally install the one-line handoff rule into the instruction file your host actually reads. Relay never edits that file silently: you see the line before it is written, and detailed instructions are read on demand.

A result file appearing or changing never completes a task. A task changes state only through a valid receipt, or through your explicit "mark handoff complete", which records a user decision. If a CLI delivery is unconfirmed, inspect the target session first; **Not received · Allow resending** permits one more send instead of automatic retry.

## What it includes

| Area | Current behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Task board | Direct CLI work requests or file handoffs, explicit conversations, single handoff or review loop, pause decisions, batch selection and task controls |
| Sessions | SQLite bindings per task, attempt, turn and Agent; targeted discovery, display cache and a fresh check before resuming |
| Agent entry | One name, one-click setup, separate manual fields, and a local configuration endpoint |
| Handoff rules | Optional one-line entry, shown for approval, details on demand, removal that preserves your other edits |
| Connection map | Direction arrows, per-direction switches, node dots for a recorded method, a failed probe or no method |
| CLI extensions | Native JSON, JSONL and final-text output adapters; separate new-session and resume probes |
| Storage | Local relay folder, retention cleanup, relocation that copies and verifies before switching |
| Appearance | Minimal, warm, fresh, night and follow-system themes; accent colours; English, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish |
| Notifications | Optional Windows helper with selectable sounds; an in-app notice while Relay is running |
| Uninstall | Per-user Windows installer; uninstall keeps data by default, or removes rules, or clears the ledger and preferences while keeping workspace files |

## Bridges, verification and cost

A bridge is one of three kinds: ACP, the running desktop app's own interface (DSH: `dsh-desktop`), or the host's CLI. Relay adapts supported native JSON, JSONL and final-text output; the host does not have to emit Relay's private receipt format.

- Sending by hand through a bridge needs only a registered method and an enabled direction. **Automatic** delivery also needs the task's opt-in and verified capability: a passing probe, where the Agent writes a marker file and you confirm the session is visible, or one real handoff turn whose receipt the Agent wrote.
- A probe calls the real CLI and may cost money. Login refusal, a missing model or missing tool permissions block automatic sending for that Agent until you choose **I have resolved · Allow automatic sends**.
- Resuming a conversation requires an exact binding, a fresh host-store check, and a matching session ID in the response. Relay does not ask models to discover session IDs or make hidden conversations visible.
- Zcode can keep old conversation content in memory after a CLI delivery. Switch to another conversation and return after about 11 minutes, or save and restart Zcode; an old view does not mean delivery failed.
- Relay aligns the known hosts' request prefixes so prompt caches keep matching across a switch — Zcode by launch flags, Hermes through its shared gateway, DSH through its running desktop. Measured cache hits after a switch were 93–99%. `cli-recipe doctor` reports launch settings that differ from the desktop's; `agent cache-check` shows each request's cache hit. For other hosts, one-click setup hands the configuring Agent the built-in `relay-cache-parity` skill.
- WorkBuddy offers no usable external interface here, so handoffs to it are copied manually.

## Development

<details>
<summary>Build and test from source</summary>

Requires the .NET 10 SDK (see `global.json`). From a fresh clone, in PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/jason-namehard/agent-relay.git
cd agent-relay
dotnet restore --locked-mode
dotnet test --configuration Release --no-restore
```

This covers Core, CLI, MCP and the core test suite. The desktop app and notification helper build separately on Windows (PowerShell 7):

```powershell
dotnet restore src/AgentRelay.Notify/AgentRelay.Notify.csproj --locked-mode
pwsh ./scripts/test-desktop.ps1
pwsh ./scripts/check-licenses.ps1 -IncludeDesktop
pwsh ./scripts/package.ps1 -Flavor Windows
```

The installer is built with Inno Setup: `pwsh ./scripts/build-installer.ps1` (pass `-Dotnet` and `-InnoCompiler` if they are not on `PATH`). Scripts accept `-Dotnet <path>`; packages go to `artifacts/packages` and existing archives are not overwritten. Regular tests use local fixtures and never call a paid model.

</details>

<details>
<summary>CLI and stdio MCP</summary>

`dotnet .\relay.dll --help` lists the commands; the MCP server does not implement `--help`. A host starts one MCP instance per Agent:

```powershell
dotnet .\mcp\relay-mcp.dll --home <relay folder> --agent <registered Agent id>
```

Tools: `relay_task_dispatch`, `relay_task_ack`, `relay_task_start`, `relay_task_complete`, `relay_task_fail`, `relay_task_status`, `relay_prompt_show`. The caller identity is fixed at startup. CLI output and most detailed documents are currently in Chinese.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Relay folder resolution</summary>

| Program | Order |
| --- | --- |
| CLI, MCP | `--home` → `RELAY_HOME` → `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AgentRelay` |
| Desktop app | `--home` → `RELAY_HOME` → folder chosen in Settings → `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AgentRelay` |
| Demo | A new folder under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AgentRelay.Demos\` |

After moving the relay folder in Settings, point the CLI and MCP at the new `--home` and copy handoff prompts again. Managed files expire after the retention period (3 days by default); keep permanent deliverables in your project folder.

</details>

## Limits

- Preview software with real gaps: real host creation, visibility and continuation need testing in that host; simulated bridges do not establish real integration. Windows display scaling and multi-monitor behaviour need manual checks.
- No background service or scheduled task. A running desktop app monitors receipts; after every process closes, overdue work waits for the next `relay recover` (CLI) or the next launch.
- Uninstall cleanup only covers rules registered for the current relay folder. Other sites you used need separate handling. Deleting the install or ZIP folder does not replace uninstalling or removing rules.
- Cancelling a task stops Relay's tracking and further delivery; it does not stop an Agent that is already working. Deleting a task removes its ledger record and keeps the files until retention cleanup.
